! Optics file to calculate the optics of the transferline BT3. The trajectory is

! based on the report PS/OP/BR/Note 81-5 from J.P. Delahaye and J.P. Rinaud.

!

!

! - BT1 recombines totaly with BT2 after BT1.KF10 and with BT3 after BT2.KFA20.

! - The QNO10, QNO20 and QN30 are misaligned.

!

! This file is for protons with energy of 1.4 GeV and momentum of 2 GeV/c

/*

Christian Carli informed me that the beam scope

is the main aperture limitation in the PS BOOSTER.

The beamscope dipoles (HOR & VER): DBSHVL4 are in P7L4, P8L4 & P9L4.



PSBBCSCR0001  Scraper  https://edms.cern.ch/file/220022/0/psbbcscr0001-v0.plt

The aperture limit in the PSB is the "beamscope window", located in P8L2.

Half_length=50 mm (hor.) and half_length=28.6 mm (vert.).

It's used for transverse emittance measurement via shaving of the beam. M.Benedict

Thickness of the beamscope (WBS) = 40 mm
